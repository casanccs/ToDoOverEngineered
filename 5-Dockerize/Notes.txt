1. Added Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose file!
2. Changed "proxy" of the frontend's "package.json" file to be the NAME of the backend's Docker Container, which is: "backend"
3. In settings for Django, changed "ALLOWED_HOSTS = []" to "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']"


Note:
1. This only works in development, as "proxy" only has effect using "npm start".

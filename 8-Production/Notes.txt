Because of deployment and pushing to Github, there are many environment variables needed. Some are:
1. SECRET_KEY
2. DEBUG
3. ALLOWED_HOSTS
4. Other custom keys


1. Using gunicorn and environment variables in the backend service
2. MUST RUN "npm run build" FIRST!!
3. Moved nginx files and changed compose build location, BECAUSE I CANNOT get the react build from up a directory.

1. Added nginx conf file, with a very simple reverse proxy to the react development server and django development server.


Note:
1. This is NOT how you use nginx in production however, because you must build the static files from react and SERVE them using nginx.
2. You also must use GUNICORN as the WSGI server. Currently I am using Django's test/development web server.

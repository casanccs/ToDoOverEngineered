1. Updated docker compose file
    - Removed the migrate from backend's Dockerfile, because when using PostgreSQL, the migrate DEPENDS ON PostgreSQL to already be running and in the network to use as a HOST in the
        settings file. Also removed the runserver command.
    - In the compose file, we needed a "depends_on" and other options to allow the backend container to wait for the db container. Placed the migrate and runserver command in the backend
        command option in order to run them when PostgreSQL was running already. Note that the depends_on option waits only for it to start, not be running.
2. pip installed "psycopg2"
3. Updated settings.py


Note:
1. It is NOT recommended to run any database as a Docker Container. Docker recommends using Docker for stateless services.
